# Project BirdName

Welcome to your birdname project!  To make sure things are working
properly, you may want to:

    $ sbt update test

There is a tutorial for what to do next, which you can find in the
scala-bootstrapper README.rdoc file.

# Documenting your project

Add documentation here!  Eventually, you'll be able to publish this to
a web site for the world to easily find and read.
